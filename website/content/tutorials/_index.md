# Learning Metaschema by example

The following tutorials provide walk-throughs for developers to understand Metaschema, its use cases, and how to use or develop news to exercise them.

- [Tutorial #1:: Getting Started with Metaschema](1-getting-started/): Introduces the basics of Metaschema-based modeling using a "computer" model as an example.
- [Tutorial #2: Using Constraints](2-constraints/): Introduces Metaschema constraints and how to use them for more precise control for values in model-based document instances. This tutorial introduces use of the `allowed-values` constraint.
- [Tutorial #3: Complex Constraints: expect](3-constraints-expect/): Introduces advanced usage of Metaschema constraints, specifically `expect` and its common use cases.
- [Tutorial #4: Complex Constraints: matches](4-constraints-matches/): Introduces advanced usage of Metaschema constraints, specifically `matches` and common its use cases.
